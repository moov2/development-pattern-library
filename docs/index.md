title: Moov2 Pattern Library
---

<p>Hello! Welcome to the <strong>SMG TDP</strong> pattern library.</p>

<h2>What is this?</h2>

<p>If you've never used a pattern library before, don't worry, a pattern library is just a collection of design elements that appear multiple times on a site.</p>

<p>These elements are called 'components' and there's a list of them in the sidebar. Click on any of these to see a preview and if you wish to use it, the required code is available underneath ready to be copied.</p>

<p>Paste this code into the page editor wherever you want the component to appear and change the preview text/content to whatever you want it to be.</p>

<h2>Common components</h2>

<p>Here are some frequently used components that might be of use:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="/components/detail/embed">Embed</a></li>
    <li><a href="/components/detail/hero-default">Hero</a></li>
    <li><a href="/components/detail/image">Image</a></li>
    <li><a href="/components/detail/list-default">List</a></li>
    <li><a href="/components/detail/summary-default">Summary</a></li>
</ul>
