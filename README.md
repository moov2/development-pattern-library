# Moov2 Pattern Library

Starting point for developing a pattern library using [Fractal](https://fractal.build/).

## Prerequisites

To setup and run Fractal you'll need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Fractal requires Node.js v4.4.7+ to run.

## Getting started

Run `npm run develop` (shortcut is to run `develop.bat`). This will spin up a local web server (http://localhost:3000) serving the pattern library.

## Distributable

Fractal caters for exporting static HTML assets for sharing the pattern library with clients / stakeholders. Run `npm run dist` to generate a distributable within the `dist` directory.
